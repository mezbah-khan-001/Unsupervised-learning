# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning: Discovering Hidden Patterns Without Labels

Unsupervised learning is a core area of machine learning that identifies patterns in **unlabeled data**. Unlike supervised methods, it doesn't rely on predefined outcomes—making it ideal for exploring raw, unstructured datasets and uncovering natural groupings or underlying structures.

This repository explores key unsupervised learning techniques, offering practical implementations and intuitive explanations.

## 🔍 What This Repo Covers

- **Clustering Algorithms**
  - `K-Means`: Fast, centroid-based clustering for finding compact, spherical clusters.
  - `DBSCAN`: Density-based clustering that excels at identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters and noise.
  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - `PCA (Principal Component Analysis)`: A powerful tool for projecting high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving variance.

## 💡 Why Unsupervised Learning?

- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection** – Identify unusual patterns or outliers in data.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customer Segmentation** – Group similar user behaviors in marketing or product analytics.
- 🧬 **Feature Learning** – Discover hidden structure in data for further analysis or modeling.

## 🔗 Real-World Applications

- Finance (fraud detection)  
- Healthcare (disease subtype discovery)  
- Retail (behavioral segmentation)  
- Cybersecurity (intrusion detection)
