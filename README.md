## 🧠 LLMs & Unsupervised Learning Integration

Unsupervised learning powers **deep personalization**. Without relying on labels, it uncovers **hidden structures** in user behavior and raw, unstructured data — like text, logs, or product descriptions.

### 🔍 Ryo’s Approach

**Clustering Algorithms:**  
- **K-Means** → Group users by similar taste patterns.  
- **DBSCAN** → Detect niche communities and outlier preferences.  

**Dimensionality Reduction:**  
- **PCA** → Reduce high-dimensional interaction data into actionable features.  
- **LLM Embeddings** → Transform raw text (reviews, chats, posts) into semantically meaningful vectors.  

**Additional Capabilities:**  
- **Anomaly Detection** → Spot unusual behaviors, bots, or fraudulent activity.  
- **Segmentation** → Build customer archetypes for targeted recommendations.  
- **Feature Learning** → Discover deep hidden patterns without human labels.
