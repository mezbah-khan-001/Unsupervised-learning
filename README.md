# Unsupervised-learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. It groups similar points (clustering) or reduces dimensions. Key algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA. No predefined labels exist, making it useful for anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and feature learning in various fields.
