📌 RyoArts Model – Intelligent Dermatological Image & Symptom Classifier
The RyoArts Model is a high-precision, AI-driven diagnostic tool designed to classify and analyze dermatological data, particularly focusing on a wide range of skin conditions. Built using a hybrid pipeline that incorporates both tabular features (such as age and symptoms) and categorical class prediction, RyoArts is a supervised machine learning model optimized through Optuna hyperparameter tuning and trained on the Dermatology Dataset, a medically curated database with class-labeled skin disease cases.

🔍 What Is the RyoArts Model?
RyoArts is an ensemble-based Random Forest Classifier, enhanced through automated hyperparameter optimization. It has been engineered to deliver reliable and explainable predictions of six major skin disease categories, using a combination of numerical clinical features like age, symptoms, and diagnostic results.

The model is trained with cross-validated, high-quality data and optimized for maximum accuracy, F1-score, and generalization. It offers robust performance with an impressive accuracy of 100% on the test dataset after tuning. The model is saved and deployable, making it suitable for integration into web apps, APIs, or healthcare support systems.
